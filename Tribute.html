            Born on September 27, 1907, in Punjab, India (now Pakistan), Bhagat Singh was a charismatic Indian revolutionary, professing socialism and atheism, whose acts of violence against the British in India, hunger-strike in jail, and execution made him a folk hero in India. He quit school at thirteen to devote his life to Indian Independence and died at a very young age of 23. He is popularly known as <i>Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh</i>. Bhagat Singh was involved in two high-profile plots against British authorities in India that helped galvanize the Indian independence movement. In 1928 he took part in a plot to kill the police chief responsible for the death of influential Indian writer and politician <i>Lala Lajpat Rai</i>. He was found guilty of killing a British police officer and <i>hanged on March 23, 1931</i>.
